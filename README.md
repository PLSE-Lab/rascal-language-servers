# Rascal - Language Servers

This project encapsulates both the Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation
of Rascal itself, and the LSP "generator" that can instantiate fresh LSPs for 
languages defined in or implemented in Rascal.

Currently we provide installers and client-specific features for VScode and 
no others.

This project is in an alpha stage; under development and tested by a small
group of early adopters. You can consider this project a replacement
for the rascal-eclipse project, but it offers more and better features.
On the other hand the rascal-eclipse project is still much more mature.
